# PLAN.md — Implementation Roadmap

Phased build plan for the E-Commerce Portal, derived from `docs/E-Commerce Portal PRD.pdf`. Stack and architecture: see root `CLAUDE.md`. Design tokens: `DESIGN.md`.

**Apps:** `apps/storefront` (Next.js), `apps/admin` (React+Vite), `apps/api` (NestJS+Prisma).

Phases are ordered by dependency: the API and data model come first because both frontends depend on them; storefront and admin then build in parallel on top.

## Progress Tracker

This is the live source of truth for task status. **Keep it updated** as work happens: flip a checkbox to `[x]` when a task is done, and update the status table below. Status legend: ⬜ Not Started · 🟡 In Progress · ✅ Done.

> **Workflow rule:** complete **one feature at a time**. After finishing any single feature, **stop and ask for verification** before starting the next. Do not batch multiple features in one go. (Mirrored in root `CLAUDE.md`.)

### App status

| App | Scaffolded | Status |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| `apps/api` (NestJS+Prisma) | ✅ | Prisma 7 wired; schema migrated; 9 modules; boots OK |
| `apps/storefront` (Next.js) | ✅ | Scaffolded (Tailwind v4 + tokens); Vitest+RTL + Playwright wired |
| `apps/admin` (React+Vite) | ✅ | Auth shell live — login + role-gated routing (React Router); Vitest+RTL (26 tests) |

### Phase status

| Phase | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Foundation | ✅ Done (apps scaffold ✅; Prisma ✅; test runners — Jest/Vitest/Playwright ✅) |
| 1 | Data model & core domain (API) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Authentication & authorization | ✅ Done (API auth ✅; storefront ✅; admin ✅) |
| 3 | Product catalog | 🟡 In Progress (API ✅ — product CRUD + category CRUD/hierarchy + search/filter/sort; storefront + admin UIs pending) |
| 4 | Cart & checkout | ⬜ Not Started |
| 5 | Orders & inventory | ⬜ Not Started |
| 6 | Customers, analytics, notifications | ⬜ Not Started |
| 7 | Non-functional hardening | ⬜ Not Started |

**Current focus:** **Phase 3 — Product catalog, in progress.** First slice **done & smoke-verified**: API product CRUD (`apps/api/src/products/*`) — create / update / archive / activate-deactivate + paginated list + get-by-id, reads public, writes `@Roles(ADMIN)`. 13 unit tests; full suite 59 green; lint + build clean; HTTP-smoked vs `ecom_dev` (role boundary 401/403, dup-SKU 409, bad-FK 400, validation 400, 404, lifecycle transitions). **Phase 3 API line ✅** (merged to `main`). **Storefront catalog in progress:** SSR product **list + detail ✅** (merged) and **category browse ✅** — SSR `/categories` tree index + `/categories/[slug]`; **search/filter/sort UI ✅** — URL-driven GET-form filters on `/products` (search, category, price range, sort). Server Components fetch the public API directly. See the Phase 3 task note below. **Next slices (separate stop-and-verify tasks):** related products on the product detail page (closes the storefront catalog task) → admin product/category management UIs. Search/filter/sort work is on branch `feat/storefront-search-filter`. (Phase 2 ✅ complete — API/storefront/admin auth, smoke-verified; details in the Phase 2 task list. Admin auth merged to `main`.)

**Carried-forward follow-ups (Phase 7 / later):** migrate admin session from localStorage → API-set httpOnly cookies (XSS-exposure tradeoff); add `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to the admin lint config; convert the placeholder sidebar nav `<span aria-current>` to real `<a>`/`NavLink` when catalog routes land. Storefront reset-link email delivery still deferred to Phase 6. **Audit logging** of product mutations (and other sensitive writes — order status, refunds, stock adjustments) deferred to Phase 7 to land once app-wide via a shared `AuditLog` helper (the model exists; no audit service yet). **Stale script:** `apps/api` `start:prod` is `node dist/main` but the compiled entry is `dist/src/main.js` (see Gotchas) — `start:prod` currently crashes; use `start:dev` for smoke runs until the script is fixed.

## Project State & Gotchas (read before resuming)

Environment facts and hard-won lessons not derivable from the code. A fresh session loads `CLAUDE.md` (+ imports) and this file automatically — this note carries what those don't.

**Local database (dev):**
- Use Postgres DB **`ecom_dev`** (migrations shadow DB: **`ecom_shadow`**). Connect as local user `sotsys033`, **no password**.
- ⚠️ A pre-existing **`ecomm`** database exists on the same server and is **NOT part of this project** (different owner role, unrelated tables). **Never migrate, seed, drop, or point Prisma at it.**
- Connection strings live in `apps/api/.env` (gitignored); template in `apps/api/.env.example`.

**Prisma 7 (≠ v5/v6 — see the `prisma-patterns` skill, now updated for v7):**
- Connection URLs are in `apps/api/prisma.config.ts`, **not** `schema.prisma`.
- `PrismaClient` **requires a driver adapter** (`@prisma/adapter-pg`); `PrismaService` is already wired this way.
- `prisma db seed` reads `migrations.seed` from `prisma.config.ts`; seed file loads its own `dotenv`.

**Build / run:**
- NestJS compiled entry is **`dist/src/main.js`** (the `prisma/` dir widened rootDir). Use `npm run start:dev` / `start:prod`; don't hardcode `dist/main.js`.
- Shell cwd resets between tool calls — use absolute paths or `npm --prefix`.

**Conventions in play:**
- Code `OrderStatus` enum values are UPPERCASE to match the Prisma DB enum (`apps/api/src/orders/order-status.ts`).
- TDD is enforced via the `.claude/` plugin; one feature at a time, stop and verify (see `RULE.md`).

**Storefront auth (Phase 2, 2026-06-15):** Session lives in **httpOnly cookies** `sf_access`/`sf_refresh` set by Next **Route Handlers** under `src/app/api/auth/*` (browser never sees tokens; handlers call the API server-to-server). `src/lib/session.ts` reads cookies and **refreshes on access-token 401**; pure `resolveSession()` is unit-tested via injected deps. `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 renamed `middleware`→`proxy`; default export must be named `proxy`) guards `/account` on cookie presence; the page re-verifies via `getCurrentUser()`. **Fixed dev ports** (so the three apps never collide): **api `:5000`**, **storefront `:5001`**, **admin `:5002`**. API port via `PORT` in `apps/api/.env` (read in `main.ts`); storefront via `next dev/start -p 5001` + Playwright `baseURL`/`webServer` on `:5001`; admin via `server.port`/`preview.port` (`strictPort`) in `vite.config.ts`. Storefront→API base URL is **`API_URL=http://localhost:5000`** (`.env.local`, gitignored; template `.env.example`). Vitest can't resolve `server-only`/`next/headers`, so `vitest.config.ts` **aliases** both to stubs in `src/test/`.

**Phase 0 test runners (closed 2026-06-15):** frontend test runners are now wired — Vitest + RTL in `admin` and `storefront`, Playwright E2E in `storefront` (each with a passing smoke test). Unit tests are co-located `*.test.tsx`; storefront E2E lives in `apps/storefront/e2e/*.spec.ts` (Vitest excludes `e2e/**`, so the two runners never overlap). Note: storefront's `next.config.ts` sets `turbopack.root` to the repo root so `globals.css` can import the shared `packages/design-tokens/theme.css` without Turbopack rejecting the `../` traversal.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation

- [x] `git init` + root `.gitignore` (node_modules, .env*, .next, dist, build).
- [x] Scaffold `apps/api` (NestJS CLI), `apps/storefront` (create-next-app, TS/App Router/Tailwind), `apps/admin` (Vite react-ts + Tailwind).
- [x] Wire `DESIGN.md` color/type/spacing tokens into both frontends' Tailwind themes (shared values via `packages/design-tokens/theme.css`, Tailwind v4 `@theme`).
- [ ] Set up Prisma + PostgreSQL connection; base ESLint/Prettier/tsconfig across apps. *(Prisma deferred to Phase 1; ESLint present per app.)*
- [x] Set up test runners per app — Jest in `api` ✅; Vitest + RTL in `admin` ✅ and `storefront` ✅; Playwright E2E in `storefront` ✅ (each proven by a smoke test).
- [x] Verify each app builds and lints clean. **Exit criteria:** all three build ✅; lint clean ✅; `apps/api` `npm test` works ✅. FE test runners pending.

> **Build everything test-first (TDD).** Use the project TDD plugin (`.claude/` — `tdd` skill, `/tdd` command, `tdd-runner` agent). Red → green → refactor; 80% coverage target. See `RULE.md` §4.

## Phase 1 — Data model & core domain (API)

- [x] Prisma schema: `User`/role, `Product`, `Category` (self-referential hierarchy), `Cart`/`CartItem`, `Order`/`OrderItem`, `InventoryItem`, `InventoryMovement`, `ProductImage`, `Address`, `Notification`, `AuditLog`.
- [x] Encode order-status enum and inventory available/reserved fields. (Code `OrderStatus` enum values aligned to Prisma enum.)
- [x] Initial migration (`init`) applied to `ecom_dev` + idempotent seed script (categories + products + inventory).
- [x] Module skeletons: `auth`, `products`, `categories`, `cart`, `orders`, `inventory`, `customers`, `analytics`, `notifications` — all wired into `AppModule`.
- [x] **Exit:** schema migrated ✅, modules wired ✅, app boots & serves HTTP 200 with Prisma connected ✅.

> Prisma 7 notes: connection URLs live in `prisma.config.ts` (not schema); `PrismaClient` requires a driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`). Env loaded via `@nestjs/config`. DBs: `ecom_dev` (+ `ecom_shadow` for migrations) — pre-existing `ecomm` DB left untouched.

## Phase 2 — Authentication & authorization (API + both frontends)

- [x] API: customer register/login/logout/password-reset/profile; admin secure login; session/JWT; role-based guards (Customer / Admin / Inventory Manager). *(JWT access + rotating refresh; `@Public`/`@Roles` guards; reset tokens emit-event-ready, email delivery deferred to Phase 6.)*
- [x] Storefront: auth pages + session handling + protected customer routes. *(✅ Done — login + register + logout + protected `/account` + password-reset (`/forgot-password` request, `/reset-password?token=` confirm) + guest guard (logged-in users bounced off `/login`,`/register`,`/forgot-password`,`/reset-password` to `/`). httpOnly-cookie session (`sf_access`/`sf_refresh`) via Next route handlers proxying the API; `proxy.ts` (Next 16 middleware) runs both `loginRedirectFor` (protect `/account`) and `guestRedirectFor` (bounce auth pages); session helper refreshes on access-token expiry. 66 unit tests + Playwright E2E green; smoke-verified end-to-end against `ecom_dev`. Reset request is enumeration-safe; confirm consumes a single-use token then revokes sessions; password delivery of the reset link still deferred to Phase 6.)*
- [x] Admin: login + role-gated app shell (redirect UX only; API enforces). *(✅ Done — `LoginPage` → `useAuth().login()`; React Router (`createBrowserRouter`) with `ProtectedRoute` gating `AppShell`→`DashboardPage`: `guest`→`/login`, CUSTOMER→Access Denied, ADMIN/INVENTORY_MANAGER→shell. Session in localStorage behind a single `tokenStore`; `apiClient` attaches Bearer + does a concurrency-guarded single refresh-on-401; `/auth/me` is the sole role authority (no client-side JWT decode). 26 Vitest+RTL tests; smoke-verified end-to-end vs `ecom_dev` (admin/inventory log in & reach the shell, CUSTOMER hits Access Denied, bad creds → generic error, refresh persists session, logout clears, CORS allows `:5002` only). **localStorage token storage is a known XSS-exposure tradeoff → Phase 7 follow-up to migrate to API-set httpOnly cookies; also defer `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` + nav `<a>`/`NavLink`.** Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/specs|plans/2026-06-16-admin-auth-shell*`.)*
- [x] **Exit:** each role can log in and only reach permitted endpoints. *(API enforces per-role; both frontends do redirect/UX only.)*

## Phase 3 — Product catalog

- [x] API: product CRUD (create/update/archive/activate-deactivate) with all PRD fields; category CRUD + hierarchy; search/filter/sort; pagination + indexes. *(✅ **Product CRUD ✅** — `products.service`/`products.controller` + DTOs; create/update/archive/activate-deactivate, get-by-id, paginated list (`{data,page,pageSize,total,totalPages}`, soft-deleted excluded, newest-first). Reads `@Public()`, writes `@Roles(ADMIN)` via global guards (API-enforced). Prisma write errors mapped: P2002→409 dup SKU, P2003/P2025→400 bad category. SKU + status immutable via generic update (status flows through archive/active endpoints). 13 Jest unit tests; smoke-verified vs `ecom_dev`.)* — **Search/filter/sort ✅** — `ListProductsDto` + `buildWhere`/`buildOrderBy` on `products.service.list`: case-insensitive `search` (OR over name/sku/description), `categoryId`, `status`, `minPrice`/`maxPrice` (gte/lte), whitelisted `sortBy` (createdAt|price|name) × `sortDir` (asc|desc, default createdAt desc); same `where` feeds findMany **and** count so totals match. No default status filter — explicit `?status=` only (public/admin split deferred to the storefront slice). 7 added unit tests; smoke-verified vs `ecom_dev` (search by name+sku, price ranges, sorts, combined query, invalid enum/negative-price → 400). Schema indexes (`categoryId`, `status`, `deletedAt,createdAt`) back these. — **Category CRUD + hierarchy ✅** — `categories.service`/`categories.controller` + DTOs. create (validates parent), findOne (parent+children, 404), `GET /categories` returns a **nested tree** (single flat query assembled server-side), update (tri-state `parentId`: unchanged/reparent/detach-to-null) with **self-parent + cycle guards** (walks target's ancestor chain), `DELETE` is **soft-delete blocked-if-in-use** (409 if non-deleted children or products remain). Slug validated (lowercase-hyphen pattern); P2002→409 dup slug, P2003/P2025→400 bad parent. Reads `@Public()`, writes `@Roles(ADMIN)`. 18 Jest unit tests; smoke-verified vs `ecom_dev` (tree, 401/409/400 guards, cycle, in-use delete, 204 leaf+empty-root delete, 404). On branch `feat/api-product-crud`.
- [ ] Storefront: SSR catalog, category browse, search/filter/sort, product detail (images, pricing, availability, related). *(🟡 **SSR list + detail ✅** — `lib/catalog.ts` (server-only typed client mirroring the API product contract, injectable `fetch`; `listProducts`/`getProduct` + base-URL-bound `getProducts`/`getProductById`; 404→null), `lib/money.ts` (display-only `formatPrice`/`isOnSale` — never computes totals), `components/catalog/Price.tsx` (regular vs struck-through sale + textual "Sale" cue, not color-only) + `ProductCard.tsx`, SSR pages `app/products/page.tsx` (grid + pagination via `?page`) and `app/products/[id]/page.tsx` (images/brand/price/availability/description, `notFound()` on 404). Server Components fetch the API directly (catalog reads are `@Public`); prices rendered as the API's Decimal strings, never recomputed. 20 added unit tests (86 total); catalog Playwright E2E (skips if API/seed absent, mirroring auth.spec). Build clean; smoke-verified storefront(:5001)→API(:5000)→`ecom_dev` (real products + prices in SSR HTML, sale `<del>`, detail "In stock", unknown id→404, page-beyond-range→200). Also fixed `lib/env.ts` API_URL default `:3001`→`:5000`.)* — **Category browse ✅** — API: `GET /categories/:idOrSlug` now resolves by **id OR slug** (OR in `findOne`'s where; enables slug URLs without a new endpoint). Storefront: `lib/catalog` extended with `Category` type, `listCategories`/`getCategory` (+ bound `getCategoryTree`/`getCategoryByIdOrSlug`) and `categoryId` in the product query; recursive `components/catalog/CategoryTree.tsx`; SSR pages `app/categories/page.tsx` (tree index of slug links) and `app/categories/[slug]/page.tsx` (resolves category by slug→`notFound()` on 404, lists its products via `?categoryId=` reusing `ProductCard` + pagination, shows subcategory chips). 14 added unit tests (94 total) + 2 added catalog E2E (4 total, all live-green); build clean; smoke-verified vs `ecom_dev` (tree+slug links, parent shows subcats/0-products, phones lists products, unknown slug→404, by-id 200).)* — **Search/filter/sort UI ✅** — URL-driven SSR on `/products`: `components/catalog/CatalogFilters.tsx` is a plain GET `<form action=/products>` (search box, category `<select>` from the flattened tree, min/max price, sort selector). Page parses `searchParams` (search, category, minPrice, maxPrice, sort=`col:dir`) into a typed `ListProductsQuery` → `getProducts`; `lib/catalog.ListProductsQuery` extended with search/min/max/sortBy/sortDir + `ProductSortBy`/`SortDir` types; pagination links preserve active filters; invalid sort falls back to default. Every filtered view is a real shareable URL (no client fetching). **Status filter intentionally omitted** from the storefront UI (customers shouldn't browse ARCHIVED/INACTIVE; API still supports `?status=` for admin). 6 added unit tests (100 total) + 1 catalog E2E (5 total, live-green); build clean; smoke-verified vs `ecom_dev` (search, price range, sort asc/desc, category, combined, no-match empty state, GET-form + nested category options, invalid sort→200). **Still pending in this task:** related products on the detail page.)*
- [ ] Admin: product management UI, category management (hierarchical).
- [ ] **Exit:** products manageable in admin, discoverable in storefront.

## Phase 4 — Cart & checkout

- [ ] API: server-authoritative cart + the `subtotal → discounts → taxes → shipping → grand total` pipeline; persist cart state.
- [ ] Storefront: cart (add/remove/update/totals), checkout (shipping info → order review → place order). **No payment** — order is created on confirm.
- [ ] **Exit:** customer can build a cart and place an order; totals match between cart and review.

## Phase 5 — Orders & inventory

- [ ] API: order lifecycle + state-machine transition guards; stock reserve on placement, deduct on fulfillment, release on cancel; inventory movements ledger; adjustments; low-stock threshold alerts; refunds.
- [ ] Storefront: order history, order details, status tracking.
- [ ] Admin: order management (view, update status, refunds, history); inventory management (stock, reports, adjustments, available vs reserved).
- [ ] **Exit:** end-to-end order flow with correct stock accounting and valid status transitions.

## Phase 6 — Customers, analytics, notifications

- [ ] API: customer management (view, order history, activity, spending); analytics aggregations (sales, inventory, products, customers); domain-event notifications.
- [ ] Admin: customer views + analytics dashboard.
- [ ] Storefront + Admin: consume notifications (customer: registration/order/shipping/delivery; admin: new orders, low-stock, refund requests).
- [ ] **Exit:** dashboards populated; notifications fire on events.

## Phase 7 — Non-functional hardening

- [ ] Performance: optimize API responses, caching, pagination review.
- [ ] Security: input validation everywhere, protected admin access, audit logging of sensitive actions.
- [ ] Reliability: error handling, monitoring, logging, recovery.
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG audit (keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast per `DESIGN.md`).
- [ ] **Exit:** non-functional requirements from the PRD met as acceptance criteria.
